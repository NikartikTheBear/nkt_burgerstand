# nkt_burgerstand

This is a simple and little resource that allows you to create usable items for burger stands and allow your player to purchase them and place them wherever they want to sell food to players.

Place them wherever you want, store items in the "drawer" of the cart, choose which recipes players can make.

To enhance roleplay also a vending license can be bought and the used stand gets the same license number to allow for police/sanitary inspection roleplay.

requires ox-lib and ox-inventory but you can use it with whatever framework you like.

Hope you enjoy.
